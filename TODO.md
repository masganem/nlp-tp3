- Analyse profile of problem
    - How many pinyin?
    - How many hanzi?
    - Implement a function to list all hanzi for a pinyin
        - If ran as main, take first cli arg and print the hanzi
    - How many hanzi per pinyin? plot distribution
        - See other plots for reference.
- Criticize metrics:
    - Expand to include recall, f1
    - How much accuracy is better than **picking most frequent pinyin per token?**;
    - Could we somehow calculate bigram or trigram accuracy?
- Actually split the dataset between train and validation
- Make jupytext notebook
    - Maybe I could run it on collab and leverage a nice tpu?
