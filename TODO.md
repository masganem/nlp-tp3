- Criticize metrics:
    - Expand to include recall, f1
    - How much accuracy is better than **picking most frequent pinyin per token?**;
    - Could we somehow calculate bigram or trigram accuracy?
- Make jupytext notebook
    - Maybe I could run it on collab and leverage a nice gpu?
    - Would it make a difference though?
